During this period, the directives and orders of the revolutionary government were the supreme law, because no constitution limited the extent and scope of such directives and orders.

However, the protection accorded to individuals under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR) and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) remained in effect during the interregnum.",

Negatively put, arbitrariness is ruled out and unfairness avoided. To satisfy the due process requirement, official action, to paraphrase Cardozo, must not outrun the bounds of reason and result in sheer oppression. Due process is thus hostile to any official action marred by lack of reasonableness. Correctly, it has been identified as freedom from arbitrariness. It is the embodiment of the sporting Idea of fair play ... It exacts fealty 'to those strivings for justice' and judges the act of officialdom of whatever branch 'in the light of reason drawn from considerations of fairness that reflect (democratic) traditions of legal and political thought.' ... It is not a narrow or 'technical conception with fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances,' ... decisions based on such a clause requiring a 'close and perceptive inquiry into fundamental principles of our society.'... Questions of due process are not to be treated narrowly or pedantically in slavery to form or phrases. .... ",
