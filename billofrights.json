During this period, the directives and orders of the revolutionary government were the supreme law, because no constitution limited the extent and scope of such directives and orders.

It exacts fealty 'to those strivings for justice' and judges the act of officialdom of whatever branch 'in the light of reason drawn from considerations of fairness that reflect (democratic) traditions of legal and political thought.' ... It is not a narrow or 'technical conception with fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances,' ... decisions based on such a clause requiring a 'close and perceptive inquiry into fundamental principles of our society.'... Questions of due process are not to be treated narrowly or pedantically in slavery to form or phrases. .... ",
